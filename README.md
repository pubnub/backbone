PubNub Backbone
========

This is a framework for [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) integration with [PubNub](http://pubnub.com). It works by syncronizing all create, update, and delete action between your Backbone collections. This gives real-time updating between Backbone collections and models on different clients.

PubNub is a real-time network that provides the core tools to build real-time applications and scale them globally. Backbone gives structure to web applications with bindings and events for web application data. Combining the two gives a rich application experience for multi-user applications such as collaboritive editing, chat rooms, and even multiplayer games.

# Installation

You can install the package using bower and `bower install pubnub-backbone` or by cloning this repository. Install the PubNub library along with this one in your html file like so, replacing the *'s with the PubNub version you want to use:

```html
<script src="http://cdn.pubnub.com/pubnub.min.js"></script>
<script src="/path/to/backbone-pubnub.min.js"></script>
```

# Getting Started

The framework works by syncronizing all create, update, and delete events between collections on all clients. This can be done manually through a plugin that hooks into the Backbone.sync method. This will give you a local collection that can be sync'ed with a remote collection that is kept up to date with PubNub. The other option is to use the custom classes provided to create a collection or model that is always in sync.

# Initialize PubNub

Once both libraries are installed and ready to go the first step is to create a shared instance of the PubNub library. This will allow your real-time collections and models to communicate across the PubNub network.

```javascript
var pubnub = PUBNUB.init({
  publish_key: 'demo',
  subscribe_key: 'demo'
});
```

# Backbone.PubNub.Collection

This collection takes the pubnub instance and a name and then publishes all create, update, and delete methods across clients using PubNub. The `name` property is used to generate a unique channel name so collections do not collide with each other. As a warning, with the same name will update each other regardless of what class they come from.

```javascript
var MyCollection = Backbone.PubNub.Collection.extend({
  name: 'MyCollection', // Used to namespace the updates to this collection
  pubnub: pubnub        // A global instance of PubNub
});

var myCollection = new MyCollection();
```

# Backbone.PubNub.Collection#history

`history()` implements the PubNub History API, retrieves items from the storage.

```javascript
var MyCollection = Backbone.PubNub.Collection.extend({
  name: 'MyCollection', // Used to namespace the updates to this collection
  pubnub: pubnub        // A global instance of PubNub
});

var myCollection = new MyCollection();

myCollection.history({count: 50});    // fetches 50 items from the storage
```

# Backbone.sync

The Backbone.sync method allows you to have a regular collection with a remote store, much like the LocalStorage module from the original Backbone Todos demo. This allows you to take updates from other clients when you want them and not automatically.

```javascript
var MyCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  pubnub: new Backbone.PubNub(pubnub, "MyCollection") // A PubNub plugin to make the collection real-time
});

var myCollection = new MyCollection();
```

# Backbone.PubNub.Model

This will create a model that is updated in real-time across all instances. This works very similarly to the collection in that it publishes all changes across the PubNub network.

```javascript
var MyModel = Backbone.PubNub.Model.extend({
  name: 'MyModel',
  pubnub: pubnub
});

var myModel = new MyModel();
```
